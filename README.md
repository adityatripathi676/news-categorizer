# Advanced News Categorization and Analysis System

## Project Overview

The Advanced News Categorization and Analysis System is an intelligent tool that leverages cutting-edge technologies like advanced data structures and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This system provides comprehensive categorization and deep insights into news articles, going beyond traditional text classification.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Intelligent News Categorization

- Multi-category classification powered by machine learning.
- Supports 5 primary news categories:
  - Crime
  - Finance
  - Technology
  - Politics
  - Sports

### 2. Efficient Keyword and Category Management

- Hierarchical organization of news categories.
- Efficient keyword search and categorization.

### 3. Advanced Text Processing

- Utilizes NLP techniques:
  - Stop word removal
  - TF-IDF vectorization
  - Text preprocessing

---

## Technical Components

### Data Structures

- **Trees**: Used for managing category and keyword hierarchies.
- **Machine Learning Pipelines**: Facilitate text categorization and analysis.

### Algorithms

#### Text Processing

- Tokenization
- Preprocessing
- Feature extraction

#### Classification

- Naive Bayes
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Model training and prediction
